This was another random python project I started after work one day. It was the first time working with pygame. I really enjoyed learning pygame and used lots of google and chatgpt to get this working in a few hours of time.
I wanted to do more with it but I feel like my time is better spent learning to use python for more practical things and not games.
I might come back to this when I have downtime.
